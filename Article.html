    <!-- General Information about Cats-->
    <p><strong>Domestic cats</strong>, also known as house cats or domestic house cats, 
	are small carnivorous mammals that are popular pets for human beings.<br /><br /> The domestic cat 
	originated from Near-Eastern and Egyptian populations of the African wildcat, Felis sylvestris
	lybica. The family Felidae, <br /><br /> to which all living feline species belong, is theorized to have arisen
	about ten to eleven million years ago and is divided into eight major phylogenetic lineages. <br /><br /> The Felis 
	lineage in particular is the lineage to which the domestic cat belongs. Several investigations have shown that all 
	domestic varieties <br /><br /> of cats come from a single species of the Felis lineage, Felis catus. <br /><br /> 
	Most cats are playful animals and enjoy socializing with people. 
	Cats like to play with toys and those that do not go outside often play hunting indoors. 
	<br /><br />Some cats, especially those that live outdoors, may be less sociable with people and other animals.</p>

			<h2>What are some of cats behaviour?</h2>
			<p>Researchers at the University of <strong>Helsinki </strong>have developed a new comprehensive questionnaire for 
			surveying feline personality and behaviour. <br /><br />A dataset of more than 4,300 cats representing 26 breed groups
			revealed seven personality and behaviour traits, with significant differences observed between breeds</p>
			<h3>Seven feline personality and behaviour traits</h3>
			<p>In a questionnaire designed by Professor <strong>Hannes Lohi's </strong>research group, personality and behaviour were surveyed through 
			a total of 138 statements. The questionnaire included comprehensive sections on background and health-related information.
			By employing, among other means, factor analysis to process the data, seven personality and behaviour traits in all were identified.
